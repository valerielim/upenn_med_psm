### Cross-sectioning and Incident (New) User Design

**Problem**

Let's say we want to look at the impact of practicing yoga on blood pressure. How do we define that?

* How long to practice yoga to qualify?
* What if they did in the past, but stopped? 
* What if they've been practicing but very irregularly?

There are **leftover treatment effects** from inconsistent-practioners, and **selection bias** from people who tried + stopped, vs tried + continuing. 

**Solution: New User Design**

- Focus on new-initiators only who are trying yoga for the first time 
- Focus on those who do it for X period of time, then measure their blood pressure

### Active Comparator Design

If there's no comparison for treatment, then it's not obvious when follow-up and tracking should start for the no-treatment group. 

So in the yoga example, we can *compare* yoga to another exercise. 

Also, because **active comparator designs** tend to involve much less confounds: People who practice yoga vs. other exercises tend to be more alike than those who don't exercise at all.

### Limitations

* Can't always have incident user design - example: effects of air pollution on health. There may not have been any period of time where people had no exposure to air pollution.
* Can't always have active comparator design - example: compare effects of smoking to ... chewing tobacco? Sometimes we're only interested in unexposed groups.
