**Question 1:** Which of the following represents what the average outcome would have been if no one was treated? 

* E(Y1) - E(Y0)
* E(Y|A=0) 
* E(Y0) -- correct 

*My explanation: the first represents the treatment effect between Y1, YO. The second represents the average outcome of people* given *they did not receive treatment. This means we are only looking at a subpopulation who did not receive treatment, but no the whole population. The third (and correct) answer represents the average outcome for the WHOLE population who did not receive treatment*.

**Question 2:** We can only observe one potential outcome for each person is: 

* Only true for immutable variables
* An example of reverse causality
* The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference -- correct. 

*My explanation: This is literally the definition of FPCI, not the other two options.*
