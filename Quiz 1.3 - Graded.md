**Question 1**: The Fundamental
Problem of Causal Inference is that:

1. we can only observe one potential outcome for each subject -- correct
* treatment is typically not randomly assigned
* causal effects are only well defined
for hypothetical interventions

*Discussion: The first option is the correct definition of FPCI. The second option is the definition of the __ assumption. The third option is just a random statement.*

**Question 2:** Which of the following represents the causal effect of treatment on the treated?


1. E(Y1)-E(Y0) 
2. E(Y1|A=1)-E(Y1|A=0)  
3. E(Y|A=1)-E(Y|A=0)
4. E(Y1|A=1)-E(Y0|A=1) -- correct

*Discussion: The first option represents the average causal effect for the WHOLE population. The second option represents the difference in positive outcome effects between treated and untreated subpopulations A1, A0. The third option represents*
